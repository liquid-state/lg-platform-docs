# Liquid Gears Integrated Web Apps (IWA)

Integrated Web Apps are small web applications. They form parts of a [native app](../native-apps/) built with the Liquid Gears Platform.

Over time Liquid Gears has developed a framework which revolves around five pillars to enable the rapid creation of quality IWAs:

- core libraries
- helper libraries for React JS
- user interface toolkit
- blueprints
- generators

All components of the framework are open source, free software and available from the [Liquid State Github organisation](https://github.com/liquid-state/).


## Core libraries

The core libraries are agnostic to any particular Javascript framework.

The core libraries are:
- iwa-core
- iwa-router
- iwa-identity


## React helper libraries

Most IWAs created by Liquid Gears and Liquid State are coded using the [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) library (note: React JS not React Native).

These libraries are:
- iwa-react-router


## Liquid State UI Kit

Liquid State has developed a UI Kit based on React and the [Ant Design library](http://ant.design).


## Blueprints

Blueprints are pre-made IWAs. They can be used as-is or as a starting point to kickstart the creation of an IWA focusing on a particular problematic.
Available blueprints are:


## Generators

Generators are templates for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) which can be used to set up all the boilerplate code for a brand new IWA.
