# Core libraries

The following libraries comprise the core of the framework and are used in almost every project:

* [iwa-core](./iwa-core.md)
* [iwa-router](./iwa-router.md)
* [iwa-identity](./iwa-identity.md)

The following libraries are useful to address partticular needs:
* [iwa-cognito-identity](./iwa-cognito-identity.md): Support for AWS cognito based identity within IWAs.
* [iwa-keyvalue-store](./iwa-keyvalue-store.md): Plugin for identity and credentials management in Liquid State IWAs.
* [iwa-desktop](./iwa-desktop.md): A set of functions and utilities to make it easy to run IWAs in a desktop environment.

##  Some example syntax for Gitbook:

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
